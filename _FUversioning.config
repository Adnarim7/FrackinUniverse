	"welcome" : "Frackin' Universe has introduced a new ^orange;Research System^reset; as of version 6.0.0 (October, 2020). 

This change completely revamps game progression from the ground up, letting users choose what they want to learn, and when, at their own pace. It also brings with it a slowed down early-game and a more trackable progression chain from mid-game and onward.
You will be required to interact directly with the ^orange;Research System^reset; to do this, however.

To access the ^orange;Research System^reset; menu, the following are options:

- Your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, via the ^green;Green Beaker^reset; icon. This is the most immediate method, and is available as soon as you start your ships computer.\n
- Via your ^orange;SAIL^reset; on your ship, in the ^green;MISC^reset; menu.\n
- Via the ^orange;Quickbar^reset;, if you use that mod. We highly recommend it.\n

^cyan;Read the Guide books in your ships storage^reset; for more detailed help about game mechanics and features.

NOTE: ^red;You should no longer have Frackin Races^reset; installed if using Frackin Universe. This will cause problems.

^orange;If using BYOS mode with custom races^reset;: you must install the addon located on Steam/CF Forums (FU BYOS Race Addon).
^orange;If using Custom Races with FU SAIL^reset;: Install theaddon via Steam or CF Forums (FU SAIL Modded Race Support).

You can open this window manually if you have the StardustLib or QuickBar mod installed via the !Updates button.
Please make sure you are not using anything included in the RED (and ideally the other colors too) on the Info tab below.

For a list of incompatible mods, check the wiki on Miraheze (NOT Fandom). It is linked on the main menu of the game. It is the most direct place to get the most updated information.


^orange;Frequently Asked Questions^reset;

Q: Where is the official wiki?
A: frackinuniverse.miraheze.org is the address. The Fandom one is incorrect, and horribly outdated. They merely want your ad revenue.

A: Yes, there is a Discord server. Check the mods page for a link.

Q: Where can I report issues/bugs, contribute, or make suggestions?
