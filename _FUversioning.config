  ^orange;Official Wiki^reset;: frackinuniverse.miraheze.org^reset;
  
  ^cyan;6.1.0 ^reset;

  -- Assets --
  * Replaced placeholder Shadow Bat with new art and monster type: the Vorp
  * added 4 additional Narcotics into the madness tree
  
  -- Dungeons --
  * Precursor dungeon: Adjusted the entity detector in the ship to only look for hostile damage team enemies
  * Gave the door to the checkpoint room additional wire connections to prevent players being trapped by crewmates
  * Tweaked item/tile placements slightly to allow the precursor mainframe, a chest and a med cabinet to place correctly
  * Increased the loot of the hidden energy pod above the molten iron room
  * Slightly increased the detection area of the proximity sensor in the energy pod room so that the lights don't turn off when you press the pressure plate

  -- Pets --
  * pets will now show their shortdescription, or their configured name (pet renamer thing), as well as showing a flavor status text below their name. this behaves similar to crew
  * removed boss bar from madness pet 'magmatop omega'
  
  -- Batteries --
  * moved all nodes
  * added an output node
  * input 1: on/off switch, like a built in relay. input 2: free, recommended to use for wiring power
  * outputs now function similar in principle to a capacity sensor. output 1: partially full. output 2: completely full

  -- Mechs --
  * mech crafting now uses FU/Vanilla resources instead of salvage. This is to remove the need to 'grind' space encounters for salvage.
  * Space salvage now yields some basic resources when Extracted as well as a nice little injection of research.

  -- Dungeons --
  * New DaE ports: 'corrupted' Cultist Altars, and Cultist Sniper Tower. Now you can figure out what the end goal of these cultist rituals is.
  * JSONified Miniknog microdungeons: Lab 1 and Lab 4. Comes in two versions. The first is a recreation of the original, the 'a' versions are my own take on them, that being lived in miniknog-occupied versions

  -- Research --
  * Each research tree has a unique background grid color. This should help with visual identification.
  * Removed all Skath resources aside from Reinforced Glass from the main trees. They are now unique to Skath nodes.

  -- Misc --
  * Adjusted all the plant recipes to fit the new agriculture tree
  * Adjusted Cell resource tiers to match the agriculture tree tiers
  * Reinforced Glass is made with 2 glass + 2 tungsten = 2 glass (instead of 2 sand + 2 tungsten = 1 glass) to slightly reduce tungsten and sand hoarding
  * Kelp Fabric has been replaced with other things in armors
  * Hydrolium Circuitry is no longer used
  * Tethyde and Hydrolium both had a single use, which no longer exist
  * Enriched Isotopes are much more common yields from the Gas Centrifuge
  * Enriched Isotopes can be researched->crafted in the chem lab - recipe is 1 rod, 1 deuterium and 10 liquid fuel 
  * Plasma cores are gone too
  * Small Fusion Reactor uses Tritanium instead of Advanced Alloy, to make it distinct from Fission Reactors
  * Large Fusion Reactor now require Particle Cores instead of plasma cores
  * Core Rifle has an additional upgrade at tier 6
  * added power switch note to hydraulic dynamo tooltip
  * Added protectorate flag to the central node
  * Reduced Prop Pack furniture prices to reasonable levels
  * Changed the mini proppack recipe to use the prop truck
  * Changed Oceanographer crew weapon loadout
  * Added extraction recipes for more ERM lootable materials
  * Added a category in the FU codex reader for all madness and elder books
  * removed FR from Includes list 
  * revised various power generating/transferring objects to also use vanilla wire signals based on power available
  * fixed a fusion generator script error.
  * Added missing crew types to the possible NPC quest recruitment options  
  * Added a new craftable paint tool, acts like the matter manipulator's paint function in a similar way to the mechanics' wrench
  * Changed the bug net and monster inspector to be one-handed, since they have no alt fires and aren't made more powerful by doing so
  * Added item network nodes to the lab storage containers (gene storage chest, food locker, wall storage)
  * Esther no longer mentioons an FTL drive at all, instead mentioning the STL. This should prove less confusing to some.
  * added periods to many item descriptions that lacked them

  -- Bugs --

  * Corrected the rarity of the space diver legs
  * fixed nebula bed effect script error. reduced value from 80 (8000%) to 0.8 (80%) mental resistance

  -- Protheon --
  This rare resource has been made more useful. Relatively new to science, it is believed to be the stuff of pure creation. It exists in trace amounts in ancient objects, artifacts and more. It's very presence causes minute changes in the universe around it. If ingested in a treated form, it is said to allow one to traverse dimensions.

	"welcome" : "Frackin' Universe has introduced a new ^orange;Research System^reset; as of version 6.0.0 (October, 2020). 

This change completely revamps game progression from the ground up, letting users choose what they want to learn, and when, at their own pace. It also brings with it a slowed down early-game and a more trackable progression chain from mid-game and onward.
You will be required to interact directly with the ^orange;Research System^reset; to do this, however.

To access the ^orange;Research System^reset; menu, the following are options:

- Your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, via the ^green;Green Beaker^reset; icon. This is the most immediate method, and is available as soon as you start your ships computer.\n
- Via your ^orange;SAIL^reset; on your ship, in the ^green;MISC^reset; menu.\n
- Via the ^orange;Quickbar^reset;, if you use that mod. We highly recommend it.\n

^cyan;Read the Guide books in your ships storage^reset; for more detailed help about game mechanics and features.

NOTE: ^red;You should no longer have Frackin Races^reset; installed if using Frackin Universe. This will cause problems.
