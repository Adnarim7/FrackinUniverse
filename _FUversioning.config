  ^orange;Official Wiki^reset;: frackinuniverse.miraheze.org^reset;

  ^cyan;6.2.0^reset;
  -------------------
  * Slime Grenade Launcher improved. Damage increase: 4 > 7.25, Explosion Time: 10 > 5 second fuse, Projectile Speed: 30 > 40. It properly applies Poison damage, Slow and DoT.
  * Increased the cost of purchasing Rob and Roger Repairos from Penguin Pete, and decreased the discount of Roger Repairos.
  * corrected character extender not registering right-hand-side races
  * It now costs 24 (rather than 8) plasmic fluid to create the x2 Xi Bulbs
  * removed a duplicate Sulphur value from deep honey ore generation
  * renamed 'Logic Node' to 'On/Off Switch' in tooltips
  * renamed Deadly Cold to Extreme Cold (same for Heat, Radiation) in tooltips and GPS 
  * Added a mission to SAIL to allow players to re-visit the Outpost if the bookmark is deleted or lost, as already existed with the Science Outpost. To enable this mission on pre-existing characters, use the command /startquest '\"fu_outpost\"' in admin mode.   
  * GiC Food items now have food effects. No longer will Bunnykin or Saturnians be able to safely eat canned tuna.
  * Only items that are identifiable (IE: Canned Chicken Soup, XBLT Sandwich, Chocolate Energy Bar, etc.) have food effects. Items that are ambigous as to what they contain (IE: K-Ration, Colony Guard Ration, etc) remain universal.
  * GiC Florans are carnivores now. 
  * Frackin and Vanilla foods are now a little more specific on what exactly they are. Fruity foods (IE Fruit Salad) are now labeled as such rather than simply 'herbivore'. Sugar Foods are now labeled as such as well. Some foods that didn't have labels now have them (ie Chocolate Bars). This makes it easier for sugar and fruit eaters, and avoids plant-based nasty surprises for carnivores.
  * Cakes (including coffee, carrot, and chocolate cakes) are now omnivore foods (new category: Cake Food) as they contain dairy, egg, and plants, and can no longer be consumed by herbivores or carnivores.
  * As a response to this, I have created 'vegan' versions of these cakes that are made with eggshoot and coconut milk instead that can be consumed by herbivores. Carnivores are still out of luck though.
  * Cheese is now correctly labeled as dairy
  * removed stat effect removal from uninit block on certain attacks, as it was causing crashes and making worlds persistently crash in exceptionally niche cases.
  * Dodge techs should properly apply their defense bonuses from armor sets and racials that improve Tech Efficiency.
  * Buffed the outputs of some tile crafting recipes.
  * Updated the Eld'uukhar flag recipe

  ^cyan;6.1.48^reset;
  -------------------
  * Added some ship components to the 'default' BYOS templates to bring them more in line with the racial ships.
  * Mechs spawned via the mech platform on a BYOS ship can now be piloted.
  * Fixed formatting in some species race effect descriptions.
  * ERM races now have their native racial descriptions in the character creation interface.
  * Fixed an infinite extraction loop of Rock Bricks.
  * Fixed some transparent pixels in the Human FTL Drive.
  * Unknown, Shadow and Superdense worlds now generate at a minimum threat level of 7, 6 and 5 respectively, to better reflect the danger they pose.
  * Fixed a typo in the name of the Toppings Bar.  
  * Various NPCs now use throwing weapons in addition to bows and other ranged weapons
  * Mech drills got a slight improvement to tile damage.
  * Metal Pipe can now be crafted after unlocking Iron crafting.
  * Xi no longer -need- to use their tech to create bulbs. They still are able to use their tech, but can also generate Genes passively (1 per 25 seconds) which they use for Bulb crafting using the C menu. They can passively generate a maximum of 100 genes.
  * Xi Water Repulsor and Xi Lantern packs now provide increased Gene production for Xi.
  * Xi food regen from planted Xi'an bulbs is improved
  * corrected a fringe error with tag caching code involving items that dont have parameters at all
  * colony cores work even if unloaded
  * colony production objects no longer produce faster based on tenant count, and instead have increased yields. Note that due to the new formulas and coding, this is a drastic nerf to overall production for users with excessive tenants.
  * changed batteries to output on their 'low power' node when at or over 10% of capacity
  * recoded colony objects to use a different diminishing returns formula
  * redid scan tooltips for all fucolony objects

  ^cyan;6.1.47^reset;
  -------------------
  * Xi Pistol renamed to Diffuse Burst. Damage Per Shot increased from 3.5 to 6.5. Knockback reduced 8 to 5. Crit Chance increased from 1 to 5.

  * added deprecated fusetbonusmanager effect, as that was lost in the armor fixes
  * timewinder schnapps is now legendary rarity, in keeping with its effects
  * pet pic reimager now only accepts one pod at a time, in the leftmost slot, and moves it to the rightmost slot. so it is noticeable when it works.
  * Fixes an error with the GPS that made it not properly take into account the every year that is a multiple of 100 and not a multiple of 400 isn't a leap year.
  * Made it so that the GPS can handle a large amount of days without erroring (though this fix could make the year, month and time in the GPS a bit less accurate)
  * Fixed the image positions of Carbon, Irradium, Xithricite and Zerchesium wall lamps.
  * Longarm Pistols now correctly display physical damage in their tooltip.
  * The species description of Thaumoths now describes their tech as 'Thaumoth Flight' rather than 'Saturnian Flight'.
  * Patched the recipes for ERM and Saturnian proto mech bodies to allow them to be crafted at T1, like other vanilla/FU starting mech parts.
  * The Medieval Workstation is now in the furniture branch of Craftsmanship, to make it less visible to new players.
  
  ^cyan;6.1.46^reset;

  * Cheeseburgers now mention all their dietary content to avoid confusion
  * Fixed a missing space in the Shovel of Crail's description.
  * Small Apex Gun ship decorations now only require tiles under the body of the gun, rather than under the barrel as well.
  * Fixed the diet description of the external Wasp race.
  * Added a new object, the Mannequin Bust, for displaying headgear.

	"welcome" : "Frackin' Universe has introduced a new ^orange;Research System^reset; as of version 6.0.0 (October, 2020). 

This change completely revamps game progression from the ground up, letting users choose what they want to learn, and when, at their own pace. It also brings with it a slowed down early-game and a more trackable progression chain from mid-game and onward.
You will be required to interact directly with the ^orange;Research System^reset; to do this, however.

To access the ^orange;Research System^reset; menu, the following are options:

- Your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, via the ^green;Green Beaker^reset; icon. This is the most immediate method, and is available as soon as you start your ships computer.\n
- Via your ^orange;SAIL^reset; on your ship, in the ^green;MISC^reset; menu.\n
- Via the ^orange;Quickbar^reset;, if you use that mod. We highly recommend it.\n

^cyan;Read the Guide books in your ships storage^reset; for more detailed help about game mechanics and features.

NOTE: ^red;You should no longer have Frackin Races^reset; installed if using Frackin Universe. This will cause problems.

^orange;If using BYOS mode with custom races^reset;: you must install the addon located on Steam/CF Forums (FU BYOS Race Addon).
^orange;If using Custom Races with FU SAIL^reset;: Install theaddon via Steam or CF Forums (FU SAIL Modded Race Support).

You can open this window manually if you have the StardustLib or QuickBar mod installed via the !Updates button.
Please make sure you are not using anything included in the RED (and ideally the other colors too) on the Info tab below.
