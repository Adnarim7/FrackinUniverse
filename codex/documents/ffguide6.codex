		"FrackinUniverse adds a large amount of armor and enhances some older ones, allowing for a greater variety of playstyles. These can be very useful through gameplay and provide exceptionally useful benefits!\n
^orange;Stats^reset; : Vanilla players may notice there are more than they are used to, and even the ones they are used to have different ranges. FU presents a wider variety of armor classes to spice up your play.\n
If you are more interested in damage, pick up Power armor or hyper power armor to trade defensive stats for offensive ones. Alternatively, pick up Tank or Power Tank sets to outlast your enemy. They come in melee OR ranged! Fighting not quite your thing? Pick up an Exploration oriented set, and be at home in your environment! You're guaranteed to locate a set that suits your playstyle somewhere out there!\n
^orange;Resistances^reset; : Many armors in FU come with inherent resistances. Many biome weather effects will simply stop affecting you once you hit an appropriate amount, and various enemy attacks will do less damage. Nifty, right? It gets better; upgrade your armor, and those resistances will increase!\n
^orange;Bonuses^reset; : Most are increases to your stats, plenty are conditional. 
Any that say ^green;+value^reset; are additive increases. If it gives ^green;+3%^reset; Crit Chance it increases your base crit chance. If it says it gives ^green;More^reset; of something, that's a multiplier on the value you currently have (Have 1000% Damage somehow? 100% More would make it 2000%!) Small note: Regen procs per second.\n
Of course, some bonuses have hidden components we couldn't easily include, for tooltip space.\n Additionally, there are some other phrase uses to note. If a set bonus states that it grants immunity to ^green;ALL^reset; of a related effect, that typically means all biome weather ^orange;as well as^reset; specific status effects related to that element. For heat, that includes burning and even lava! For radiation, that includes rad-burn.
As a small side-note, some terms or symbols are used loosely. If you see a bonus with x/y, that means the bonuses are different based on how their conditions are met. For weapons, this means how many of that type.\n
^cyan;Mining Sets^reset; :\n Mining laser sets grant a lot more mining laser damage...but that bonus is reduced significantly if you are pairing them with something else. Using a mining laser with a pistol, as example: 100% More Mining Laser Damage becomes 25%.
^orange;Colors^reset;: Colors are important in set bonuses. If something is ^green;GREEN^reset;, that means it is a good thing. ^red;RED^reset; means it is a bad thing. ^cyan;Cyan^reset; is for things that are binary. They typically do not stack with similar effects.\n
^orange;Special Bonuses^reset; : Some sets have special bonuses that don't really display much information due to lack of space, an unfortunate limitation of the game.. Here, some bonuses will be explained.
^cyan;Auto-Medic^reset;: More complicated than straight regen, this effect will restore more health per second at the cost of an equal percentage of energy.\n
^cyan;Thorns^reset;: a nova of thorns when hit, ^cyan;Fire Burst^reset; makes a nova of fire instead.\n
^cyan;Summons Minions^reset;: summons short-lived alllies to fight alongside you or distract enemies. These minions scale based on the lowest armor's tier, so upgrading it is essential! Upgrade ALL of the pieces.\n
^cyan;Life/Energy Shell^reset;: Gain damage absorbtion based on your resources to protect your health. Regenerates quickly if you haven't taken damage recently. ^cyan;Shell Immunities^reset; are granted only while the shell holds.\n
^cyan;Gravity Normalization^reset;: Personal gravity too low? Up it goes. Too high? Down instead. Exception: Zero-gravity.\n
^cyan;Vital Power^reset; and ^cyan;Juggernaut^reset;: these effects are set bonus exclusive, and quite powerful; they grant one stat based on a percent of another. Vital power grants power as life, Juggernaut grants life as power.\n
^cyan;Undying Resolve^reset;: increases Protection as your life gets lower, up to the stated amount, while Immortal Resolve grants HP Regen instead.\n
^cyan;Dark Commander^reset;: Increases Damage, Protection, HP and Speed of nearby summoned pets by the listed percent, increases their jump ability by half of that, and regenerates HP at a sixth of that amount per second.\n
^cyan;Charisma^reset;: Your ability to bargain with Traders at space stations. The higher your charisma, the better the deal (and fatter your bank balance!)"
